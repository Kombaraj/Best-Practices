Service Mesh

Configurable Infrastructure Layer for Microservices applications. It provides microservices governance by adding necessary visibility and security controls. 

When you have thousands of Discrete services the service mesh helps discover, authorize, track the different service instances. 

One way to implement s service mesh is with sidecars. Sidecars handles intercommmunications with features such as:
* Service Discovery
* Load balancing
* Encryption
* Authentication and Authorization
* Monitoring 
* ....Anything that can be abstracted away from the individual services. This way developer can focus on coding features that add business value rather than infrastrutcure related requirements. 

Istio is a service mesh designed to make communication among microservices reliable, transparent, and secure. Istio intercepts the external and internal traffic targeting the services deployed in container platforms such as Kubernetes.

Though Istio is capable of many things including secure service-to-service communication, automated logging of metrics, enforcing a policy for access controls, rate limits, and quotas, we will focus exclusively on the traffic management features.

Istio lets DevOps teams create rules to intelligently route the traffic to internal services. It is extremely simple to configure service-level properties like circuit breakers, timeouts, and retries, to set up a variety of deployment patterns including blue/green deployments and canary rollouts.



Network Traffic Management
	Loadbalancing (Challenge is proliferation of Load balancers)
	Routing (Header based, Path based, Weight based, Mirror Live Traffic)
	Deployment Patterns (Dark Launch / Blue Green / Canary / A-B Testing)
	
Network / Service Resiliency
	Rate Limiting
	Circuit Breaker (To prevent our service going down when they are under high load / cascading failures using Outlier Detection, Self healing, Istio vs Netflix Hystrix Library)
	Fault Tolerance (Retry Policy, 	Timeout)
	Fault Injection (OR) Chaos testing (delay, abort)
	
Security
	Authentication
	Authorization
    mTLS
	Policy

Observability
	Metrics
	Tracing
	Logging

Service Discovery
	Discovery
	Health Check
	
*****************************************************************************************
Blue / Green Deployment
	It’s basically a technique for releasing your application in a predictable manner with an goal of reducing any downtime associated with a release.

A/B Testing
	It's a way of testing features in your application for various reasons like usability, popularity, noticeability, etc
	
Canary Deployment
	Canary release is a technique to reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by slowly rolling out the change to a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire infrastructure and making it available to everybody.
