Best Practices:
Git -> Source of Truth 
	Pipeline as Code
	Paramaters inside Jenkinsfile - Not in the UI parameters
Jenkins -> Hashicorp Vault -> Role ID / Secret ID
Optimize Jenkins Configuration
	Disable unused plugins
	Avoid excessive use of sh or bat steps
	Purge old builds
	Clear workspace
Seed Job
	A Jenkins seed job is a special type of Jenkins job that uses the Job DSL plugin to programmatically create and manage other Jenkins jobs.
Shared Libraries
	Shared libraries in Jenkins Pipelines are reusable pieces of code that can be organized into functions and classes. 
	Manage Jenkins » System » Global Trusted Pipeline Libraries -> Select "Shared Library" Git repo and branch
	@Library("shared-lib@master")
Parallel execution ( 'parallel' inside 'stage' block)
Regularly update Plugins
Deployment Approach (Helm, GitOps ArgoCD)
